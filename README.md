### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Currently I'm building Intersectional Acts Inc., an non-profit that focuses on supporting people who experience multiple and intersecting forms of harassment, discrimination, violence, and systemic oppression. 
- ðŸŒ± This year I'm try to explore and learn everything TECH! My goal is to brainstorm, explore, and develop ways to apply my knowelege and 15+ years of professional experiences working with oppressed communities, survivors of violence, advocates and social services professionals, human resource business partners, civil rights workplace and school investigtors, supervisors and leaders, educators, student services professionals, medical professionals, law enforcement, and legal professionals so that I can help create TECH solutions that are able to effectively reduce systems based trauma and improve the lives of individuals and communities forced to endure oppression.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to US employee or student rights, civil rights, ADA, Title IX, Cleary Act, workplace violence, safety planning, emergency and crisis response (including organizational communications and PR best practices), trauma-informed communication, privacy, confidentiality and informed consent, employee relations, people and culture, or prevention.
